# Microsoft Program Synthesis using Examples SDK

The Program Synthesis using Examples (PROSE) SDK includes a set of technologies for the automatic generation of programs
from input-output examples.  The SDK is split into a series of nuget packages that can be used independently or in
concert.  Each package references which ever others it depends on as needed, so just install the packages you need for
your scenarios, or install the top-level `Microsoft.ProgramSynthesis` package to get everything.

## Getting Started

You can find samples for consuming the SDK as well as the release notes at https://github.com/microsoft/prose.

## License

The PROSE SDK is available for non-commercial use only.  See the [LICENSE.txt](LICENSE.txt) file for more details.

## Contributing

The PROSE SDK is closed source (except the usage samples), but if you run into problems, please [open an
issue](https://github.com/microsoft/prose/issues), and someone from the PROSE team will work with you to see if the
problem can be addressed.
